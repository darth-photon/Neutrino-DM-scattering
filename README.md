# Neutrino-DM-scattering Cascade equation solver

This code solves the cascade equation that describes neutrino dark matter scattering. It can be generalized to any scattering with some edits

# Installation

To use this code, you need to have Python 3 or Julia installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website and Julia from the official website.

Once you have installed Python or Julia, you can clone this repository by running the following command in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neutrino-dark-matter-scattering.git`

# Usage

## Python
To use the Python implementation, you need to have the following libraries installed. 
1. numpy
2. scipy
3. tables
4. csv
5. pandas
6. matplotlib

You can install these using pip or package managers like conda. To run the code, navigate to the directory where you have cloned the repository and run the following command:

`python neutrino_scattering.py`

This will generate the output in the console.

## Julia
To use the Julia implementation, you need to have LinearAlgebra and Plots packages installed. You can install them by running the following commands in your Julia REPL:

`using Pkg;
Pkg.add("LinearAlgebra");
Pkg.add("Plots")`

To run the code, navigate to the directory where you have cloned the repository and run the following command:

`julia neutrino_scattering.jl`

This will generate the output in the console and plot the results.
