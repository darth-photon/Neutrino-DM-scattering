# Cascade equation solver (Neutrino-DM-scattering in Blazars) 

This code solves the cascade equation that describes neutrino dark matter scattering. It can be generalized to any scattering with some tweaks.

# Installation

To use this code, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python from the official website and Julia from the official website.

Once you have installed Python, you can clone this repository by running the following command in your terminal:

`git clone https://github.com/yourusername/neutrino-dark-matter-scattering.git`

# Usage

## Python
To use the Python implementation, you need to have the following libraries installed. 
1. numpy
2. scipy
3. tables
4. csv
5. pandas
6. matplotlib

You can install these using pip or package managers like conda. To run the code, navigate to the directory where you have cloned the repository and run the following command:

`python neutrino_scattering.py`

This will generate the output in the console.

# Modification for other scenarios

The code can be modified to other scattering scenarios.
